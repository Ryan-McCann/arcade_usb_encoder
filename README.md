# Arcade USB Encoder

The purpose of this project is to program an LPC11U24-based board to act as a USB HID Gamepad for an arcade cabinet. This project supports up to one trackball, one spinner, and 18 pushbuttons.

The motivation for creating this project was to have each player's set of controls show up as a single device in order to make configuration of multi-player cabinets simpler.
